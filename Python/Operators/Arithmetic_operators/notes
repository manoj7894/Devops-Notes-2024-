# What is Arithmetic Operator
Arithmetic operators in Python allow you to perform basic mathematical calculations on numeric values. These operators include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.

# List of Arithmetic Operators
-> Addition (+): Adds two numbers.
-> Subtraction (-): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
-> Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.
-> Division (/): Divides the left operand by the right operand (results in a floating-point number).
-> Floor Division (//): Divides the left operand by the right operand and rounds down to the nearest whole number.
-> Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.
-> Exponentiation ():** Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.
