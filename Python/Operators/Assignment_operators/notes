# What is assignment Operator
-> Assignment operators in Python are used to assign values to variables

# List of assignment operators
-> Basic Assignment (=): Assigns a value to a variable.

-> Addition Assignment (+=): Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

-> Subtraction Assignment (-=): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

-> Multiplication Assignment (*=): Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

-> Division Assignment (/=): Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

-> Floor Division Assignment (//=): Performs floor division on the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

-> Modulus Assignment (%=): Calculates the modulus of the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

-> Exponentiation Assignment (=):** Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
