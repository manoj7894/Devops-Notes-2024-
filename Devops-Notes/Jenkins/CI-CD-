# What/why is CI/CD
-> CI/CD means continuous Integration, continuous delivery and also continuous deployment is a process to 
   automate software delivery by automating tasks like build, Test and deploy

# What is continuous integration
-> Whenever developer changes the code it will automatically build code the with all dependencies and libraries 
   and automatically test the code
  Build -> unit -> merge

# What is continuous Delivery  [Prepod]
-> Continuous delivery is the process in CI/CD. continous delivery is a process of making sure that the software is ready
   it can be released anytime you want
-> The final production deployment will be manual.
   Build -> unit -> merge -> acceptence test -> Deploy to staging -> Deploy production
                                                                  manual   

# What is continuous Deployment
-> Continuous deployment is the process in CI/CD. Continous deployment is a process of deploying your
   application or software or kubernetes cluster. it can be deployed automatically whenever developer change the code in git repo.
-> The final production deployment will be automatically.
  Build -> unit -> merge -> acceptence test -> Deploy to staging -> Deploy production
                                                                automatically

# What is the difference between continuous deployment and continuous delivery
 Continuous deployment
-> The deployment to the production environment is fully automated does not requir manual and human intervention

Continous delivery
-> In this process some amount of manual intervention with the manager approval is need for deployment to a production environment


# Stages in CI/CD
-> Source stage -> When any changes made in your source code and CI/CD pipeline trigger to build stage
-> Build stage -> In Build stage your code is build with dependencies and libraries to create the build and artifact. after build to going to the next stage that is test stage
-> Test stage -> In test stage it will automatically test your application. if you detected any error. you may resolve in test stage. after test stage going to next stage is deploy
-> Deploy stage -> In Deploy stage your application will deploy into the server

# Benifits of CI/CD 
-> Quicker time to market
-> Higher qulity
-> Reduced the risk
-> Collaboration
-> repaid delivery

# CI/CD tools
-> Jenkins
-> Gitlab
-> Git Actions
-> etc..
