sudo systemctl status jenkins                
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
     
-> After complete the jenkins instalition You will copy your Public Ip and paste that ip in your web browser along with port number[jenkins default port number is 8080]
-> Then It will ask the password you will paste initialAdminPassword there and install all plugins
-> later on you fill username and password and start the jenkins
-> After Start the jenkins You will go to manage jenkins and go to Plugins and install Eclipse Temurin installerVersion and jdk related plugins
-> After Install the Java plugins again you go to manage jenkins and go to tools and install java JDK8 and JDK11 and maven.         
-> later on you create one job
-> In Build Triggers we have two main options 
  -> Build perdically [It will build the job whichever time you want]
  -> POLL SCM [It will build the job whenever developer change code in github]
       * minute[0-59] 
       * hour[1-23]             
       * day of month [1-31]
       * month of the year [1-12]
       * day of the week [0-6]
-> cd /var/lib/jenkins/workspace [To see whatever jobs you have created in jenkins]
-> sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/jenkins [To see and change the port number in jenkins]
-> Do restart the jenkins after change the port number [sudo systemctl restart jenkins]
-> vi /var/lib/jenkins/config.xml [if you forget the jenkins password you will go that file write false on true place]
-> Do restart the jenkins after change the Password [sudo systemctl restart jenkins]
-> Do you want to configure Apache-tomact server in jenkins. You have follow the below steps
   -> You have to install Below tomact commands in jenkins terminal
   -> cd /opt
   -> sudo wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.82/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.82.tar.gz
   -> sudo tar -xvf apache-tomcat-9.0.82.tar.gz
   -> cd apache-tomcat-9.0.80
   -> sudo vi webapps/manager/META_INFA/contex.xml      
	allow ".*"                          
   -> cd /conf
   -> sudo vi server.xml  --> To change the port number                                            
   -> sudo vi tomcat-user.xml
-->
  <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
  <role rolename="admin-gui"/>
  <role rolename="manager-script"/>
  <user username="tomcat" password="tomact" roles="manager-gui"/>
  <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui,manager-script"/>
</tomcat-users>

   -> cd /bin
   -> sudo sh startup.sh
