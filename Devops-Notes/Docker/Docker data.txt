# What is Docker
Docker is a set of platform as a service product that use os-level virtualization to deliver software in packages is called container
Docker is a platform that allow the application you to package and distribute software application in container
Docker is used to manage the container based application
Deployment into multiple environment easy if we use docker
It is a containerisation software
Docker is a containerization platform that provides easy way to containerize your applications, which means, using Docker you can build container images, run the images to create containers and also push these containers to container regestries such as DockerHub, Quay.io and so on.

# How docker will work 
Docker will abstruct and package developer written code. After that it will create on image. later we will run our machines using that images 

# What is Container
-> container is a way to package application with all the necessary dependencies and configuration
-> Containers having lite weight operating system [Why it is lite weight operating system it doesn't have full operating system. it has base operating system. it get the resources from base OS]
we can run containers in multiple machines easily
container will take every thing which is we required


# What is Virtualization
It is a old technique to run the application
we need to install hydervisior software to use

# What is hypervisior
-> Hypervisior is a software that install the virtual machine in azure like ec2 in aws in servers
-> We have two types of hypervisior
  -> Virtual machine
  -> Xen

# What are the difference between Docker and  virtualization
   Docker                  virtualization           
1) Size is small         1) Size is big
2) Startup is very fast  2) Startup is slow
3) Integration is good   3) Integration is bad

# What is Docker Hub
Docker is a cloud based repository where we can share and store images. its like a market place for conatainer


# How to install Docker
1.sudo yum update -y
2.sudo yum install docker -y
3.sudo service docker start
4.sudo chkconfig docker on
5.sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
6.docker --version
7.sudo service docker start
8.sudo service docker status
9.docker info
If it is not work once you will exit from instance and again you will login

# Docker Terminolory
1) Docker file 
2) Docker images
3) Docker container
4) Docker Registry
5) Doker engine or Docker demon


# Files and Folders in containers base images
    /bin: contains binary executable files, such as the ls, cp, and ps commands.

    /sbin: contains system binary executable files, such as the init and shutdown commands.

    /etc: contains configuration files for various system services.

    /lib: contains library files that are used by the binary executables.

    /usr: contains user-related files and utilities, such as applications, libraries, and documentation.

    /var: contains variable data, such as log files, spool files, and temporary files.

    /root: is the home directory of the root user.


# Files and Folders that containers use from host operating system
    The host's file system: Docker containers can access the host file system using bind mounts, which allow the container to read and write files in the host file system.

    Networking stack: The host's networking stack is used to provide network connectivity to the container. Docker containers can be connected to the host's network directly or through a virtual network.

    System calls: The host's kernel handles system calls from the container, which is how the container accesses the host's resources, such as CPU, memory, and I/O.

    Namespaces: Docker containers use Linux namespaces to create isolated environments for the container's processes. Namespaces provide isolation for resources such as the file system, process ID, and network.

    Control groups (cgroups): Docker containers use cgroups to limit and control the amount of resources, such as CPU, memory, and I/O, that a container can access.
    

# what docker file
Docker file contains instruction to create an images
Dockerfile is a file where you provide the steps to build your Docker Image.
It contains Domain specific language keywords to build the image

# How to create Docker file [Default file name is Dockerfile]

FROM: To pull the base image

RUN: To execute commands [If you want to execute the linux and bash commands then we will use run]
                          [Run command will excute while creating the image]
CMD: To provide defaults for execute container [CMD instructions will execute while creating the container]
 
ENTRYPOINT: Entrypoint and CMD both are equal We can over write CMD but we cant the Enrtypoint

WORKDIR: To set the working directory

COPY: It copy files from one place to another place

ADD: ADD it is also copy files from one place to another place
But when we use ADD we will copy github data and website URL and It extract the Zip and tar files automatically

EXPOSE: It will Expose your listener Port number

ENV: To set the Env variables

# What is Docker image or container image
-> executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and system tools
Docker image is package that contains everything needed to run a software including the code, runtime, libraries
 and system tools. Its like a snapshot of a Docker containter.

Docker images commands
docker images  --> To see the docker images
docker pull imagename --> To pull the image from docker
docker login  --> Docker hub login in our terminal
docker tag imagename manoj3003/imagename  --> before push you have to tag our image
docker push manoj3003/imagename   --> Push the image to dockerhub
docket build -t imagename .  --> To build the image
docker build -f dockerfilename -t imagename .  --> To build the image file would be in other loaction[pending]
docker rmi imagename  --> To delete the docker image 
docker rmi $(docker images -q)  --> To delete all the images

# What is Docker container
Docker conatainer is runnable instance of docker image

Docker container commands
docker run -d --name nameofcontainer -p 8081:80 imagename --> port mapping  [8081 place is hostip and 80 place is container ip]
docker run containername  --> To run when we execute ctrl+c it will exit
docker create imagename  --> To run the container without exit 
docker start containername --> To start the container
docker stop containername  --> To stop the container
docker ps --> To see the running containers
docker ps -a --> To see the overall containers 
docker exec -it containername /bin/bash --> To enter into the container
you will enter into containter even below below
docker run -it --name con2 img1 /bin/bash --> directly you will enter into the container and container will aslo created
docker start containername
docker attach containername
docker rm containername  --> To delete the container
docker kill containername  --> To delete forcefully
docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq) --> To remove all container at a time

# what is Docker registry
Docker registry is a place where we can store our docker images

# what is Docker engine or Docker daemon
The Docker daemon (dockerd) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. A daemon can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services.
Docker engine is a software using which we will create docker image and docker container

# What is Docker volume
Docker volume are used to presist the data generated by docker container

Advantages of container
1) share volume amoung different container
2) On deleting container volume will not deleted.

we will create volume in two ways
1) Automation
2) manual

Automation way means we will mention volume in docker file
FROM amazonlinux:latest
VOLUME ["/name1"]
WORKDIR name1
RUN manoj1

docker build -t imagename .
docker run -it --name conatainername imagename /bin/bash
after enter into the container we will check volume is created or not

manual way means we will create the volume by using command
docker run -it --name containername -v /volumename imagename /bin/bash

After creating the volumes to see that volumes you will use below commands
docker volume ls  --> To get the volumes
docker inspect volume volumename --> you will get volume storage path and full details about volume
cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/   --> we will get volume data in this path suppose if container will delete and stop
docker volume create volumename --> To create volume name
docker run -it --name=containername --mount source=volumename,destination=/data imagename  -> To attach the volume to container
docker volume rm volumename  --> To delete the volumes
docker volume prune -->  It will delete all unused volumes

we will transfer volumes in two ways
1) Container to Container
2) Host to Container

How to transfer volume from Container to Container
docker run -it --name newcontainername --privileged=true --volumes-from existingcontainername imagename /bin/bash
After executed above command when add the any files in newcontainer automatically it will add to the another container also

How to transfer volume from Host to Container
docker run -it --name containername -v pathname:newvolumename imagename /bin/bash

# Docker network
Docker netwrok is a virtual network that allows containers to communicate with each other.
It provides the isolation and allows container to connect to each other using network interface

Note: One container we will attach the muliple netwrok when we attached container to mulitple network then those container
can communicate 

when we installed the docker software by defaultly three networks drivers will avaliable[docker network ls]
1) Bridge driver [It is default network driver, you can communicate by using portnumber]
2) Host driver [It is default network driver, you can communicate without portnumber]
3) None driver [No network access to the container]
above three are defaultly
4) overlay driver [we will use overlay driver when we have docker swaram]
5) Macvlan Driver [When we the macvlan driver we will use get mac address]

whenever we create the container defaultly it conncet to the bridge driver

How to create the network
docker network ls --> To network drives
docker inspect containername  --> To see what network driver has attached to that container
docker inspect network containername --> same
docker network create --driver <drivername> <networkname>  
[Drivername means what do want brige or host or none or overlay or macvlain]
docker run -d --name containername --network <drivername> -p 8080:80 imagename --> To add network drivers
docker run -d --name containername --network host -p 8080:80 imagename --> To add the host network driver
docker run -d --name containername --network none -p 8080:80 imagename --> To add the none network drivers
docker run -d --name containername --network <newnetworkname> -p 8080:80 imagename --> To add different network name

Sample project
docker run -d --name con1 --network <newnetworkname> -p 8080:80 imagename
docker run -d --name con2 --network <newnetworkname> -p 9080:80 imagename
After run the above containers and execute the below commands
docker start con1
docker attach con1
apt-get update
apt-get install iputils-ping
ping con2 ip  [Ip avaliable in docker inspect containername]

docker start con2
docker attach con2
apt-get update
apt-get install iputils-ping
ping con1 ip  [Ip avaliable in docker inspect containername]

# What is Docker Compose
Docker-compose which is used to managed the multiple container based application
Using docker compose we can define and deploy multi container based application
Docker compose having yaml file. default file name is docker-compose.yml

# How to install docker-compose
sudo yum update -y
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
docker-compose --version

Docker-compose commands
docker-compose up --> To create and start the container
docker-compose ps --> To see the docker container
docker-compose down --> To stop and down the container
docker-compose images --> To see the images
docker-compose -f <filename> up --> To run the specify file
docker-compose -f <filename> down --> To down the specify file

docker log containername

# Restart policies
we have four types of restart policies in container
-> no
-> always
-> unless-stopped
-> on-failure

docker run -d --name containername --restart always imagename sleep 10  -> it will restart the container eveny 10 sece because you have montion always in policy
