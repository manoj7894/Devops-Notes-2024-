-> Continuous intrigation
-> Continuous deployment
-> Infrastructure as a code
-> Automation
-> Monitoring

# what development team wiil do 
-> Take the requirments from client
-> Based on requirment to develop the code
-> Test the code
-> Keep the source code in github repo

# What operation will do
-> Set the virtual machine
-> Set the servers
-> Set the data base
-> Take the source code from github repo
-> Build the source code
-> Deployment in server
-> Delivery


# What is Software development Life Cycle[SDLC]
-> The process of developing and deployment of the project is called SDLC
-> Requirments from client
-> Planning
-> Develop the code based on client requirment
-> Test the code
-> Deployment
-> Delivery
-> Maintence

# What are the advantages of devops
-> Speed
-> Rapid Delivery
-> Security
-> Quality and reliablity
-> Improved colliboration

# What is waterfall methodology
-> We can't change the any modification in waterfall methodology
-> It is step by step process
-> It move only farward direction
-> Client involument is very less
-> Client will see the project end of the project
-> Requirment is fixed
-> budget is fixed

# What is Agile methodology
-> We can change the modification in agile methodology
-> Requirment is not fixed
-> Budget is not fixed
-> It move forward and reverse direction
-> Client involumet is ver high
