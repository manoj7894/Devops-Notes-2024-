# What is AWS
-> AWS stands for Amazon web service. It's a secure cloud platform. 
-> It provide the on-demanding resources for hosting web services, storage, networking, database and other resources over the internet with pay as you go pricing.

# What is meant by region, availablity zone, edge location
-> Region: Regions in cloud computing refer to geographic locations where cloud providers have data centers. Each region contains multiple data centers.
-> Availablity zone: Availability Zones are isolated locations within a region that have their own power, cooling, and networking. They are designed to provide high availability and fault tolerance
-> Edeg location: Edge location is a important part of AWS infrastructure. Edge location are CDN endpoint of cloud front to deliver the content to end user with low latency.

# Is it possible to reduce a EBS volume (Just read to get ne idea)
Yes, it is possible to reduce the size of an EBS volume in AWS, but with some limitations and considerations.

Here’s a breakdown of how it works:

1. For General Purpose SSD (gp3) and other EBS types:
Directly reducing the size of an EBS volume is not supported directly in AWS.
However, you can shrink the file system and then create a snapshot and restore the snapshot to a new, smaller volume.
Steps to reduce the size of an EBS volume:
Backup: Take a snapshot of the existing volume to prevent data loss.
Shrink the file system:
Log into your EC2 instance and reduce the file system size to fit within the desired new volume size.
For example, if you're using ext4 or xfs, you can resize the file system using commands like resize2fs for ext4.
Create a new volume: After shrinking the file system, create a new EBS volume with the desired smaller size.
Copy data: Mount the new volume and copy the data from the old (larger) volume to the new (smaller) one.
Detach the old volume: Once you’ve confirmed everything is working properly on the new volume, you can detach the old volume.
2. Elastic Block Store Snapshots:
AWS allows you to take snapshots of volumes. When reducing the size of a volume, this snapshot is typically useful as a backup or to restore data if necessary.
Limitations and Considerations:
Data loss risk: If the volume is not properly resized before transferring data, you risk losing data that exceeds the new smaller volume's capacity.
Downtime: There may be some downtime during the resizing process since you will need to detach the old volume and attach the new one.
Volume type: This process is applicable to most volume types, but the exact steps may vary depending on the file system used and the operating system of your EC2 instance.
Alternative - Elastic File System (EFS):
If your use case involves frequent resizing and dynamic scaling, consider using Amazon EFS, which automatically scales up and down, eliminating the need to manually adjust volume sizes. However, EFS is not suitable for all workloads, especially those requiring block-level storage.

In summary, while direct reduction of EBS volume size isn’t supported, the process of resizing can be achieved with a workaround involving shrinking the file system, creating a new volume, and transferring the data.



# I need modify the ebs volume in linux and windows is it possible
-> yes its possible from console use modify the volumes in section give size u need
-> In windows go to disk management for linux mount it to achive the modification

#  You have an Ec2 instance that has an unencrypted volume. You want to create another encrypted volume from this unencrypted volume. Which of the following steps can achive this
-> Create one snapchat of unencrypted volume and copy the snapchat and create volume from that copied snapchat

# What is Amazon EBS-Optimized instance
-> This optimization provides dedicated throughput between Amazon EC2 and Amazon EBS, which ensures that EBS performance is predictable and consistent.
-> When you select the amazon EBS-Optimized for instance you will pay additonal hourly charge money for instance.

# What is EBS Snapshot
-> It can take backup on EBS volume. Snaphots are incremental backups
-> If this is your first snapshot it will take some time to create. snapshot are point in time of copies of volume.


# What is EFS
-> EFS is a elastic file system it is scalable and fully managed file storage service in provided by AWS.
-> EFS is provides a simple and elastic file system that can be mounted a mulitple Ec2 instances.
	Scalability: It is automatically scales your file system
	Performance: Efs provides the low-latency and high throughput file storage.
		     EFS is unlimited of Size
		     EFS is Costly


# What is the difference between Bloack storage and File storage
# Block Storage:- 
-> Block storage operates at lower level, raw storage device level and manage the data as a set of numbered and fixed size block
# File Storage:-
-> File Storage operates at higher level, the operating system level and manage the data as a name hierachy of files and folder

# Example:-
The key difference between block storage and file storage lies in how data is stored, accessed, and managed. Here's a breakdown of their characteristics and differences:

1. Block Storage
Data Structure: In block storage, data is stored in fixed-size blocks. These blocks are individual chunks of data that are addressed by their unique block addresses.
Access: Block storage operates at the lowest level of storage, and data is accessed at the block level. This means the storage system is agnostic to the data format and allows any application or operating system to use it.
Use Cases: Block storage is typically used for applications that require high-performance storage with low latency, such as databases, virtual machines, and operating system drives.
Examples:
Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)
AWS EC2 instances' storage
Hard drives (HDDs) or solid-state drives (SSDs) in computers or servers
Performance: Block storage is generally faster and offers better performance than file storage because it works at the raw data level.
2. File Storage
Data Structure: In file storage, data is organized and stored as files within directories, and it's usually accessed via a file system. It works in a hierarchical manner, where files are organized in folders or directories.
Access: File storage operates at the file level. It includes both the file and the metadata (like file name, permissions, etc.). You typically access it using protocols like NFS (Network File System), SMB (Server Message Block), or others.
Use Cases: File storage is used for applications that need shared access to files or require easy management of large amounts of data organized in directories, such as file sharing, media storage, backup systems, and collaborative applications.
Examples:
Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)
Google Cloud Filestore
Network Attached Storage (NAS)
Performance: File storage may have slightly higher latency compared to block storage, as it needs to manage the file system overhead and metadata, but it is still well-suited for many shared use cases.

Conclusion:
Block storage is suitable for applications where performance, speed, and direct access to raw storage are critical, like databases or operating system disks.
File storage is best for managing and sharing files in a more user-friendly way with an organized file system structure. It's ideal for workloads like shared file systems or file backups.




# What is Auto Scaling
-> Autoscaling allows you to automatically scale up and scale down the number of instance depends on cpu utilization and memory utilization.
-> we have two types of autoscaling

-> When you want to have static IP address for your instance when you stop and restart your instance. you will use EIP address.

# By default how many elastic ip address does AWS offer
-> 5

# What is the use of elastic ip are they charged by AWS
-> These are ipv4 address which used to connect the instance from internet. they are charged if the instance are not attached it.

# What is static IP
-> It is a constant and perment IP it wil never change when you stop and restart the instance

# What is Dynamic Ip
-> Ip will change whenever you stop and restart the instance.

# What Ip
-> IP stands for internet protocal. It will communicate the data from one system to another system

      one octet having 8 bites
      one bytes having 8 bites

# What is subnet
-> Subnets are associated with route tables that control the traffic flow within the VPC. 
-> Public subnets typically have a route to an Internet Gateway (IGW) to allow internet access for resources within the subnet, while private subnets route traffic through NAT gateways.

# What is VPC
-> VPC stands for virtual private cloud in aws. 
-> It is virtual network in AWS
-> It allow you to control your vitual network environment.

Note: We can assign the ips using CIDR
      CIDR stands for Classes inter Domain Range.
# Ranges
  10.0.0.0/16  -> This is one ipv4 range
  this comes upto 65535 because above ip is ipv4 ip it have 32 bit and above ip range is 16
  32 -16       16
 2        ->  2     -> two power 16 is 65536 but we will take 65535
because 65536 it is allocated to broad casting it wont work in AWS network.

-> Highest range is 16 in VPC
-> Lowest range is 28 in VPC
   10.0.0.0/16  = 65536
                    32-32
   10.0.0.0/32  = 2        = 0
                    32-31         1
   10.0.0.0/32  = 2        = 1 = 2  = 2
                    32-30         2
   10.0.0.0/32  = 2        = 2 = 2  = 4
                    32-29         3
   10.0.0.0/32  = 2        = 3 = 2  = 8
                    32-28         4
   10.0.0.0/32  = 2        = 2 = 2  = 16

-> If you have 8 even VPC dont allow that range
-> Mostly 16 and 24 ranges will be use in VPC.
   
# What is the difference between pubilc Ip and private Ip or subnets
-> Public Ip having internet access
-> Private Ip dont having internet access

# What is the difference between NACL and SG
# NACL [Network access control list]
-> It will work upto subnet level
-> NACL will apply automatically when we create the resource
-> It is a stateless because we can give permission to inbound and outbound rule
-> We can attach only 1 NACL to subnet
-> We can create both allow and denied rules

# SG [Security Group]

# What is the difference between VPC and VPN
The main difference between a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and a Virtual Private Network (VPN) in AWS is that a VPC creates a private network within a public cloud, while a VPN provides secure access to those resources remotely:

Difference between VPC and VPN
1.   vpc is a virtual private cloud within public cloud 
2.  vpc is created by public cloud with private network environment 
3.  it' s easy data to securely transfer to a private environment . 
4 . Vpc is the networking part .

VPN is a virtual private  network.
VPN is a secure connection over the. internet protect data .
